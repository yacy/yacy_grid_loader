# limitation and throttling:
# A limit is the maximum number of entries that a queue may take. This is a configuration which is passed to
# the RabbitMQ queue initialization. If the limit is set to 0, it means no limitation.
# In case that a target queue reaches it's maximum, it will reject new entries, followed by a requeueing of already dequeued messages
# of origin queues.

# is approaching the throttling number, reading from the origin queues is throttled (= pauses are made, processes act slower).
# Queue limit numbers cannot be compared with trottling numbers, because queue limits denote absolute numbers of one queue
# while throttling numbers denote the sum of all entries in target queues. It should hold:
#     throttling < limit * number-of-target-queues
# But as long as throttling >= limit it could happen that a queue reaches it's limit before throttling starts. To be save, set
#     throttling < limit
# A throttling of 0 means no throttling.
